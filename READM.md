## CONTACT APPLICATION

1. The complete application is build using gwt techniques.
	I have made 2 basic Classes for the 3 basic buttons:  Add Contact, Edit and Delete. The three methods are as follows : 

	a. NewUser : The add contact method is invoked when we add data to our database. I have created a TREEMAP which sorts and puts the name(key) in the data base. The values associated with this key are stored in an ARRAYLIST. 

	
	b. ExistingUser : the editing and deleting the contact are going to be related with the existing user.

	b.1. putedit : This method is used to edit a previously stored contact and update the database accordingly.

	b.2. putdelete : This deletes the dataentry and updates the database accordingly.

	Every time we use any of these 3 functions we change the database and display the updated version. 

2. Styling and UI : 

	I have used CSS to style the elements according to my liking. The code is in the .CSS file.



 Directory structure:
 --------------------------
ContactApplication/build.xml

after you run that or before you run it i have provided my application output in the following directory: 

Directory structure:

ContactApplication/
	war/
  ContactApplication.html
---------------------------

3. I hope you find the application satisfactory and i am glad i got to learn so much while building the same. Let me know where all i can improve and if i went wrong. 

NOTE: 
I also implemented the SAFEHTMLUTIL features for security measures. I understand how important security is for such web applications ,and i could implement it to protect HTML entries from hindering some of the other features.
